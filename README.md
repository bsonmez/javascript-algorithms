# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

## Data Structures

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. More precisely ,a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms

Algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithm is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigms are general approaches to the construction of efficient solutions to problems. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.
