# Linear Search

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

So we say that the linear search algorithm is O(n).

To run tests simply run:

```
npm test -- -t 'linear-search'
```
