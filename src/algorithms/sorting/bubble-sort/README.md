# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a 
simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through 
the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent 
items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps 
are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

To run tests simply run:

```
npm test bubblesort
```
