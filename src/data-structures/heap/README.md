# Heap

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if **P** is a parent node of **C**, then the key (the value) of **P** is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of **C**. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

To run tests simply run:

```
npm test -- -t 'minheap'
```
